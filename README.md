This is a week long project that was for the Global AI Hub ML Bootcamp.

* children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
* smoker: Smoking
* region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

What we are trying to predict.
