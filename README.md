This is a week long project that was for the Global AI Hub ML Bootcamp.

It entails developing an end-to-end data science application using this [dataset](/insurance.csv). The aim of the project is to estimate the approximate cost of a person's health insurance based on the given variables.

* age: age of primary beneficiary 
* sex: insurance contractor gender, female, male 
* bmi: Body mass index, providing an understanding of body, weights that are relatively high or low relative to height, objective index of body weight (kg / m ^ 2) using the ratio of height to weight, ideally 18.5 to 24.9 
* children: Number of children covered by health insurance / Number of dependents
* smoker: Smoking
* region: the beneficiary's residential area in the US, northeast, southeast, southwest, northwest.

What we are trying to predict.

* charges: Individual medical costs billed by health insurance.
